Pocket Tanks is the fast-paced artillery game that is simple to learn, and fun to master.  
It is a very interactive game where the players try to hit a target on the other side of wall. 
In order to win game players uses some different methods like changing the height of the wall, the position of the wall, angles, wind speed as well as power. 
One can only win a game if the opposition gets bury in a mound of dirt or assail him with a barrage of bullets.
This model is based on the classic game Tank Wars. Game starts with two tanks, where one of the tanks fires on their target of another tank to smash them with fireball, but before reaching to the target fireball needs to over comes some obstacles like wall which is in between both tanks. So, for that player must determine the wall height and wall position. Gravity and wind also play an important role. Now, tank link with guns and when the fireball is shot from the tank, it leaves x and y origin along with velocity. The code prompts the fireball to die as soon as it is reached in the boundaries of the map. 
   
Pocket tank is the perfect quick game which can be play with friends and family, you will find yourself hooked for hours of play!! And from childhood I was curious to know how developers are making this game by creating such small details like the fireballs not going through the walls by identifying patch colors, how the position of the turtle changes when hit by fireballs. We just understand working and applications of tank1 created the game which can be played by two players. The agent Tank is act upon wall height, wall position, wind flow. So as a result, player has to set angle and power accordingly to hit the fireball at designated target.
